When user presses 
********************************************************************/
// ***********************************************//
// TODO NEXT: x. figure out how to make 
// x. add events to pet, lights off and feed buttons so hunger, sleepiness, and boredom will go up by one. also set hunger, sleepiness and boredom to X number and set interval them to go to zero.
// 			x. finish katagachi methods, feedUp method should subtract one from hunger
// 			x. lightsOff method should subtract one from sleepiness
// 			x. petUp should subtract one from boredom
// 		X.connect above methods to corresponding event listeners, so when you click the buttons, the function runs and subtracts from the proper span.
// 		X. add more shit to the game object, functions n stuff so you can just type game.start(); at the end of your code and have the whole game run.... i think..
// 		X. figure out how to put my katagachi onto the screen. instantiate the katagachi onto the screen and have it chill there, when it dies. it goes away.. maybe with jquery animation
// 		// X. connect the input form in the beginning where you input your katagachi's name and click the name your pet button to start the game and instantiate your katagachi to the screen with all its properties that are decrease or increase 
// 		X. max on the timer is 60s. if timer === 60s jquery the name your pet button into a button that refreshes the page. 

//x.

hey everyone, my name is Fil and this is my tomagotchi project. The basics of this game is simple, you type in your name in the input field and hit create your pet and you're off to the races! If either boredom, sleepiness or hunger hits 6 you lose. Why six? 10 was too easy and 3 was waay too hard. Make it to 60s of stress inducing button pressing and you win!
