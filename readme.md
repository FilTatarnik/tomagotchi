hey everyone, my name is Fil and this is my tomagotchi project. The basics of this game is simple, you type in your name in the input field and hit create your pet and you're off to the races! If either boredom, sleepiness or hunger hits 6 you lose. Why six? 10 was too easy and 3 was waay too hard. Make it to 60s of stress inducing button pressing and you win! 

*********************

thhis project really taught me about jquery and how you can use it to manipulate things on the page with out having to edit the html

also it taught me about animations


i was super excited about having the input box disapear and the name inputted in the form appear above the pet that you created... but was always there.. 

also this loading circle thing you see at the top left. i was super pumped when that actually came together, even tho i had help from the internet. 

unfortunelatly i really wanted to have an all black  div  slide into frame when the page refreshed, along with the loading circle and the instructions on how to play the game, then slide out of frame allowing you to begin!

adding animations was kind of annoying becuase i completely forgot that you had to link the libraries in the index.html head or body tags for the animations to work. 

other than that i'm super happy with how it came out.
